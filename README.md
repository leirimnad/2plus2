# 2plus2 is four

Minus one, that's three, quick maths

Every day, man's on the block

Smoke trees (Ah)

See your girl in the park

That girl is a uckers

When the ting went quack-quack-quack

You man were ducking (You man ducked)

Hold tight, Asznee (My brudda)

He's got the pumpy (Big ting)

Hold tight, my man (My guy)

He's got the frisbee (Few)

I trap, trap, trap on the phone

Movin' that cornflakes (Uh)

Rice Krispies

Hold tight, my girl Whitney (My G)

On, on, on, on, on the road doin' 10 toes

Like my toes (Like my toes)

You man thought I froze

I see a peng girl, then I pose (Chilin')

If she ain't on it, I ghost

Hah, look at your nose (Check your nose, fam)

You donut

Nose long like garden hose
